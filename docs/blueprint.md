## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calm yet hopeful light-blue (#79BAF2), suggestive of future horizons and opportunities. The hue is close to that of LinkedIn, and its lightness projects calm and security without being overly serious.
- Background color: Very light grayish-blue (#F0F4F7), almost imperceptibly tinted, for a clean, professional backdrop.
- Accent color: A vibrant and energizing purple (#A78BFA), for calls to action and highlighting key information.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif. It is versatile, and appropriate for headlines or body text
- Use clean, modern icons from a consistent set, with a focus on clarity and ease of understanding.
- Employ a clean and structured layout, prioritizing user experience and ease of navigation. Utilize whitespace effectively.
- Incorporate subtle and meaningful animations to enhance user interaction and provide feedback. For example, smooth transitions when navigating between sections or displaying new information.
